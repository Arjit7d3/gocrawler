# GoCrawler

A lightweight, extensible **web crawler** written in Go.  
Designed for small-to-medium crawling tasks with HTML parsing, asset extraction, URL normalization, and CSV reporting. Intended as a developer-friendly tool and learning project for building crawling pipelines in idiomatic Go.

---

## Features

- Crawl pages and extract structured data (title, text content, images, links).  
- Normalize and deduplicate URLs before crawling.  
- Export crawl results to CSV reports.  
- Includes unit tests for key parsing/normalization functions.  
- Modular code organized into small, testable Go files (see repository file list). citeturn0view0

## Requirements

- Go 1.20+ (or the version specified in `go.mod`)  
- Network access to crawl target sites

## Quick start — build & run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arjit7d3/gocrawler.git
cd gocrawler
```

2. Build:

```bash
go build -o gocrawler .
```

3. Run (simple):

```bash
./gocrawler
```

> The crawler's runtime configuration (flags, timeouts, concurrency limits, seed URLs, etc.) is defined in `configure.go` — check that file for available options and default values. citeturn3view0turn1view0

## Running tests

Unit tests are included for parsing and normalization helpers. Run all tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```

You can run or inspect specific tests like `get_urls_from_html_test.go`, `normalize_url_test.go`, etc., which cover common edge cases.

---

## How it works (brief)

- `main.go` sets up the crawler and configuration, coordinates workers, and writes output. citeturn1view0  
- URL normalization & deduplication prevent redundant requests (`normalize_url.go`).  
- HTML fetching & parsing extract text and images (`get_html.go`, `get_images_from_html.go`).  
- Extracted data is transformed and written into CSV reports (`csv_report.go`).

---

## Example usage ideas

- Generate a CSV list of images for a small site.  
- Use as a starting point for an indexing pipeline or site map generator.  
- Extend `extract_page_data.go` to extract additional structured fields (meta tags, schema.org, JSON-LD).

## Extending & Contributing

This project is organized to be easy to extend. Recommended contributions:

- Add more robust politeness (robots.txt) and rate-limiting.  
- Add parallelism controls and worker pools for larger crawls.  
- Add retry/backoff and improved error handling.  
- Add HTML parsing improvements (more robust extraction, support for JS-rendered pages via headless browser).
